Machine Learning

Bias and variance

higher bias--algnot complex
High variance---> overfitting

conditional prob(white and black balls)
joint prob(tossing a coin)

clustering (based on some factor like age group..)
Association(Amazon way)

Dimensionality reduction:
---subfield of unsuoervised learning
Principal component analysis(PCA)

Data mining(unsupervised learning)

Data model(mean median..)
Alg model(regression linear reg corelation)

Deep Learning(subfield of ML)

pip3 install scikit-learn / sklearn


sigmoid fn
(becomes 1 when z is infinity)

cost fn(idea to minimize the cost)--->Gradient Desant

Decision Tree Learning

Information gain


Entropy

Homogenous---E = 0
equally divided sample-->E=1

E(P)-E(0) = Infor gain
