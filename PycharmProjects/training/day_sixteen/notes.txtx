;
penalty

l1 - linear (Can easily predict which x is showing waht values)
l2 - quadratic (rate of change....no change when x becomes 0)

increasing the lineraization, decreasing the variance --decreasing the overfitting
bias -underfitting
variance - overfitting

increasing lambda...increase regularisaion strenth--decreas var

drasticially decrase c means inc bias
