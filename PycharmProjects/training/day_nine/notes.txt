debugging:
to find logical error when the pgm is running correctly bt no expected op

pdb.run()


ptrace(process tracer)
a parent can look into chld stack to look whats happening
run()checks what are the values that are not showing up correctly.

Why interprocess comm is reqd:(for the process to comm with each other using)
pipe (similar to file)
shared memory (Both process can read and write)

message queue

so oly in process pgm, we track x with the help of a file.

pdb.set_trace():

can put in any func in any line
which when hits that place, starts the debugger.

file  :dict_pdb.py

pdb.post_mortem():
